# Jumblr

Jumblr is a proof of concept spinoff of Tumblr, made by yours truly, Joe Rashid. Done in my free time during my job search, this project ties in my favorite parts of Instagram in my own twist on Tumblr. Users will be able to explore blogs, which are collections of posts made by a user or group of users, or see individual posts on their timeline. Images and videos uploaded to the site will be stored securely in an AWS S3 bucket and tied to a user. Users can like others' posts or leave "Jotes", Joe-Notes which are essentially comments that feature image replies.
